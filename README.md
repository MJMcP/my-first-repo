# My first Repo - working on README file layout
## as described in 'Rescue Your Work from Certain Death' video tutorial README.md Files

[Link to the live deployed project should be frist on the content of this page](https://codeinstitute.net)

A description of what the site is about (don't forget your screenshots for representations and explanations)
What your aims are for users (first time, returning, frequent) and what the administrator is looking for 


what technologies have been used in the creation of this site - what languages, frameworks, libraries and programs used to create items or edit items this would also include visual aids and colour assistants

 
What features you'd like to add.


And, it also gives credit for any code that's been taken from other places,
such as libraries that you might have imported, or code that you found on Stack Overflow.  Even code that fellow students have helped you with, it's good to credit it here.  

Header examples include 
 - CODE  (image godes, library supports, pattern vailidation codes with links to all of the prevelant elements)
 - CONTENT  who supplied the content for the pages, why were these coleours chosen and how, 
 - MEDIA  any images, video or audio should be accredited here
 - ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS  to individuals who helped or you wish to dedicate it to


It should also contain screenshots of your finished project and details about how you
tested and deployed the project and also how someone could clone and deploy it for themselves.

List the validators who supplied it and provide screenshots either within the doc or by links to the results
Testing the user storeies from UX section - how did the final product respond to the requirements DON'T BE AFRAID TO MENTION HOW IT DIDN'T

## Be as honest and detailed as possible in your README.md file.

Explain what works, what you didn't have time to do, what functionality
you'd like to add in the future, and what bugs you found and squashed along the way.

If you want, you can even separate your tests into a TESTING.md file if you want to keep
things a bit easier to read. A detailed README MD file can really help the reader to get a feel
for your project and your vision as a developer. It's also essential for your milestone projects!
